Stealing the Crown Jewels: The 2008 Oil Industry Cyber Intrusion
================================================================

In 2008, at least three major US oil companies - [Marathon Oil Corporation](https://www.linkedin.com/company/marathon-oil-corporation/), [ExxonMobil](https://www.linkedin.com/company/exxonmobil/), and [ConocoPhillips](https://www.linkedin.com/company/conocophillips/) - were targeted by a series of cyberattacks that may have originated in China. The breaches, which were not publicly disclosed at the time, focused on stealing valuable "bid data" detailing the quantity, value, and location of oil discoveries worldwide. The companies were not aware of the full extent of the attacks until they were alerted by the [Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fbi/) in 2008 and 2009. The data exfiltrated included e-mail passwords, messages, and other information tied to executives with access to proprietary exploration and discovery information.

The cyberattacks were sophisticated and used custom-made spyware that was virtually undetectable by traditional antivirus and electronic defenses. The attackers were able to gain access to the companies' networks and exfiltrate sensitive data without being detected. The [Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fbi/)'s National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force confirmed that the attacks were state-sponsored and that the target was bid data that would be valuable to state-owned energy companies.

While the involvement of China in these attacks is not confirmed, experts believe that the country would be interested in this type of data. With China's economy consuming large amounts of energy, the country's state-owned oil companies have been aggressively pursuing leases worldwide, particularly in countries like Nigeria and Angola. Knowing the location and potential yield of oil deposits would give China a significant advantage in bidding wars for prime leases.

This incident highlights the vulnerability of the oil industry to cyber attacks and the importance of proper cyber security measures. The oil and gas industry is a critical infrastructure that is vital to the functioning of the economy. The theft of bid data can cause significant financial losses and give foreign entities an unfair advantage in the global market.

Oil companies must take the necessary steps to protect their networks and data. This includes regular security assessments, employee education on cyber security, and implementing advanced security measures such as intrusion detection and prevention systems. Additionally, companies should have incident response plans in place to quickly detect and respond to cyber-attacks.

[Marathon Oil Corporation](https://www.linkedin.com/company/marathon-oil-corporation/) is an American petroleum and natural gas exploration and production company headquartered in Houston, Texas. The company was founded in 1887 and has operations in the United States, Angola, Canada, Equatorial Guinea, Iraq, Libya, and the United Kingdom. Marathon Oil is one of the three US oil companies targeted by cyberattacks in 2008, which were focused on stealing valuable bid data detailing the quantity, value, and location of oil discoveries worldwide. The incident highlights the vulnerability of the oil industry to cyber attacks and the importance of proper cyber security measures.

[ExxonMobil](https://www.linkedin.com/company/exxonmobil/) Corporation is an American multinational oil and gas corporation headquartered in Irving, Texas. The company was formed in 1999 by the merger of Exxon and Mobil. [ExxonMobil](https://www.linkedin.com/company/exxonmobil/) is one of the world's largest publicly traded oil and gas companies and is known for its strong financial performance and large reserves of oil and natural gas. The company was also one of the three US oil companies targeted by cyberattacks in 2008, which were focused on stealing valuable bid data detailing the quantity, value, and location of oil discoveries worldwide. The incident highlights the vulnerability of the oil industry to cyber attacks and the importance of proper cyber security measures.

[ConocoPhillips](https://www.linkedin.com/company/conocophillips/) is an American multinational energy corporation with its headquarters located in the Energy Corridor area of Houston, Texas. It is the world's largest independent pure-play exploration and production company and is also one of the largest oil and gas companies in the United States. The company was also one of the three US oil companies targeted by cyberattacks in 2008, which were focused on stealing valuable bid data detailing the quantity, value, and location of oil discoveries worldwide. The incident highlights the vulnerability of the oil industry to cyber attacks and the importance of proper cyber security measures.

This incident serves as a reminder that cyber-attacks are not just a theoretical threat, but a real and present danger that can cause significant financial losses and affect national security. As technology continues to advance, the risk of cyber attacks will only continue to grow. Companies must take proactive measures to protect their networks and data from cyber espionage.
