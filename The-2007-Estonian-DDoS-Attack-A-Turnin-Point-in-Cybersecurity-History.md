The 2007 Estonian DDoS Attack: A Turning Point in Cybersecurity History
=======================================================================

In May 2007, the Estonian government networks were targeted by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack by unknown foreign intruders, most likely at the behest of the Russian government. The attack resulted in the disruption of some government online services and the temporary halting of online banking. This attack was significant as it was one of the first large-scale state-sponsored cyber attacks and it created a wave of fear in cyber-dependent countries like the United States.

The attackers used a botnet, a network of compromised computers, to launch a DDoS attack on the Estonian government websites. The goal of the attack was to flood the targeted websites with a massive amount of traffic, making them unavailable to legitimate users. The attackers also targeted the websites of private businesses and media outlets.

The Estonian government responded quickly and effectively to the attack. They worked with international partners and private sector companies to mitigate the attack and restore services. Additionally, they implemented measures to improve the resilience of their networks and infrastructure against future attacks.

This incident highlighted the need for countries to have effective cyber incident response plans and the importance of international cooperation in addressing state-sponsored cyber attacks. It also served as a wake-up call for other countries to improve their cyber defenses and to be prepared for potential state-sponsored cyber attacks.
