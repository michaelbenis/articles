The Oak Ridge National Laboratory Cyber Incident of 2007: A Case Study in Spear Phishing
========================================================================================

Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) experienced a cyber incident in October 2007 where more than a thousand staffers received an email with an attachment that, when opened, provided unknown outsiders with access to the Lab's databases. The incident was detected as a "sophisticated cyberattack" and authorities suspected that the hackers were based in China. The intrusion was under active investigation by multiple agencies, including the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security. The statement from Laboratory Director Thom Mason said the attack "appears to be part of a coordinated attempt to gain access to computer networks at numerous laboratories and other institutions across the country."

The attack was initiated through spear phishing emails, which trick employees into clicking on a link or opening an attachment by disguising the email as legitimate. In this case, the attackers sent seven phishing emails that appeared to be an announcement for a scientific conference or a notice of a complaint on behalf of the Federal Trade Commission. Approximately 11 employees opened the email attachments, which enabled the hackers to infiltrate the system and remove data. The lab's investigation found that approximately 11 employees took the bait and opened the email attachments.

The attackers were able to steal personal information of visitors to the laboratory between 1990 and 2004, including names, dates of birth, and Social Security numbers. The lab attempted to contact the possible victims of the breach, but acknowledged that "the large number of out-of-date addresses will complicate this effort." The incident resulted in a large number of attempts to steal data with a very sophisticated strategy.

This incident highlights the importance of employee awareness and education in preventing spear phishing attacks. It's important for organizations to implement security measures and train employees to recognize and avoid spear phishing emails. It's also important for organizations to have incident response plans in place in case of a breach. In addition, organizations should consider implementing security controls such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and encryption to protect sensitive data.

It's important to note that the Oak Ridge National Laboratory was not the only organization targeted in this coordinated attack. Other federal labs, such as Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and California's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, were also targeted. This highlights the need for organizations to not only focus on their own security measures, but also to be aware of the larger threat landscape and to share information and best practices with other organizations in order to better protect against such attacks.

Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is a multi-disciplinary research facility operated by the Department of Energy (DOE). ORNL is one of the largest science and energy national laboratories in the world, and it is home to one of the world's most powerful supercomputers. ORNL conducts research in a wide range of fields including materials science, nuclear science, energy production, and environmental science. In addition to its research activities, ORNL also provides technical support to other national laboratories and government agencies.
