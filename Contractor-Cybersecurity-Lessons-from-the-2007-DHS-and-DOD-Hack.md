Contractor Cybersecurity: Lessons from the 2007 DHS and DOD Hack
================================================================

In September 2007, a cyber incident occurred where contractors employed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Defense (DOD) had their networks hacked. The attackers were able to gain access to the networks by using a variety of tactics, including spear phishing, malware, and network penetration. Once they had gained access, they were able to establish backdoors into agency systems and potentially steal sensitive information.

The incident was significant as it highlighted the vulnerability of government contractors to cyber attacks and the potential impact of these attacks on national security. The attackers were able to exploit the trust relationship between government agencies and their contractors to gain access to sensitive information and systems.

The incident also serves as a reminder of the importance of proper security controls and incident response plans for contractors who handle sensitive information and systems. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities in contractor networks.
