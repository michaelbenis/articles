2007 China Aerospace Science & Industry Corporation (CASIC) Network Breach by Foreign Hackers
=============================================================================================

In October 2007, the Chinese Ministry of State Security reported that foreign hackers, 42% of which were believed to be from Taiwan and 25% from the United States, had been stealing information from key areas in China. This revelation came after a 2006 survey of the China Aerospace Science & Industry Corporation (CASIC) Intranet Network found spyware on the computers of classified departments and corporate leaders.

This incident highlighted the ongoing threat of cyber espionage and the need for improved cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive information and critical infrastructure. It also served as a reminder of the global nature of cyber threats and the need for international cooperation in addressing them.

The Chinese government responded to the incident by increasing its efforts to protect against cyber attacks, including the implementation of stronger security controls, advanced intrusion detection and prevention systems, incident response plans, and training for government personnel.
