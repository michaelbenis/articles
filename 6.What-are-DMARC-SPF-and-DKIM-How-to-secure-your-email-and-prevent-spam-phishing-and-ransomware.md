What are DMARC, SPF, and DKIM? How to secure your email and prevent spam, phishing, and ransomware
==================================================================================================

Inbound and outbound communication is essential to any business. It allows you to interact with customers, employees, and suppliers in a way that is more efficient and effective. Without good email authentication, for example, you may not be able to connect with customers or make sure your messages are considered safe. DMARC helps protect your email addresses from being used by spammers, SPF ensures that all emails sent through your domain are marked as coming from the intended recipient, and DKIM helps ensure that emails sent from one domain are signed with the same key as all other emails from that domain.

### What is DMARC and why is it important

Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) is an email security protocol that helps to prevent cyber attacks. DMARC helps to protect the user by verifying that the email submission came from who claims to be the sender and not from an attacker.

DMARC help protect your online reputation. This is done by verifying the source of the communication against a list of known sources. If the communication is valid, then the message is allowed to proceed to the recipient.

### What is DKIM

DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is used to identify the sender of messages. It is an extension of DMARC and helps keep communication secure. DKIM uses public key cryptography to sign messages, guaranteeing that they were not forged or tampered with in any way.

DKIM helps protect online communications. DKIM allows you to identify your email content and messages using a unique key. This allows you to protect your identity and prevent others from pretending to send emails pretending to be you.

### Use DKIM to identify the sender of messages

DKIM allows you to identify the sender of a message by their email address. This can be helpful when you want to prevent someone from falsely claiming responsibility for a message or when you need to be sure that an email was sent from the correct person.  

### Use DKIM to sign messages

DKIM helps secure the transmission of messages by creating a digital signature that proves that the message was sent by the right person. This allows you to ensure that your emails are not fraudulent or malicious.

### Use DMARC, SPF, and DKIM to prevent email spoofing

DMARC, SPF, and DKIM use rules to determine whether a message should be considered valid or not. These rules check received emails and decide if they should be accepted as part of your defense against forgery or not.

### Conclusion

Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC), Sender Policy Framework (SPF), and DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) are important tools that help protect your online reputation, communications, and identities. By using these technologies, you can create a secure and healthy online environment for yourself and your business.
