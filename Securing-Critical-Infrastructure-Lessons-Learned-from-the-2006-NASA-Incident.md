Securing Critical Infrastructure: Lessons Learned from the 2006 NASA Incident
=============================================================================

In December 2006, NASA was forced to take drastic measures to protect against cyber attacks on its networks, specifically before shuttle launches. The space agency blocked emails with attachments out of fear they would be hacked and reported that plans for the latest U.S. space launch vehicles had been obtained by unknown foreign intruders.

This incident highlights the growing concern about cyber espionage and the potential impact it can have on national security and critical infrastructure. The fact that the plans for the U.S. space launch vehicles were obtained by unknown foreign intruders is a serious concern as it could potentially compromise the integrity and success of the launch. NASA's decision to block emails with attachments before shuttle launches was a proactive measure to prevent further breaches and protect against potential sabotage.

NASA's response to the incident also highlights the importance of incident response planning and the need for organizations to have a plan in place to quickly and effectively respond to cyber incidents.

According to Business Week, NASA's incident response to the cyber attack was not disclosed publicly and the attackers were not identified. But it is reported that NASA and other US government agencies have been targeted by foreign governments and other actors in the past, and it is likely that the incident was a targeted cyber espionage campaign.

This incident serves as a reminder of the importance of cybersecurity in protecting critical infrastructure and sensitive information, and the need for organizations to take proactive measures to detect and prevent cyber-attacks. NASA's case shows the importance of incident response planning and the need to be prepared for potential cyber-attacks, even in critical infrastructures that are not directly connected to the internet, such as space launches.
