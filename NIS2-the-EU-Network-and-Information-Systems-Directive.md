NIS2, the Network and Information Systems Directive
===================================================

NIS2, the Network and Information Systems Directive is a directive of the European Union (EU) that aims to improve the security and resilience of network and information systems and to increase the level of cybersecurity in the EU.

The directive applies to operators of essential services (OES), such as energy, transport, and healthcare, as well as to digital service providers (DSP), such as online marketplaces, search engines, and cloud computing services. It requires these companies to take appropriate measures to secure their systems and to notify authorities of any incidents that could significantly impact the continuity of their services.

The directive also establishes a cooperation and information-sharing framework between member states and the EU and requires member states to designate national competent authorities to oversee the implementation and enforcement of the directive.

Overall, the NIS2 directive is intended to improve the security and resilience of critical infrastructure and digital services in the EU and to ensure that the EU is better prepared to respond to and recover from cyber incidents.
