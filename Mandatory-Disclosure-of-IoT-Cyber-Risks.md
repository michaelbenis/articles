Mandatory Disclosure of IoT Cyber Risks
=======================================

The Consumer Protection and Fair Trade Authority issued a new directive requiring the disclosure of cyber security information prior to purchasing smart products that can be connected to the Internet (Internet of Things, IoT). The disclosure must address the exposure to cyber risks, the ways to defend against these risks, and that the products may be misused by a malicious party for the purpose of carrying out a cyber attack

The disclosure must be made before making the purchase, and at all stages of the purchase, including the marketing and advertising stages. Also, the disclosure must be clear and comprehensible to the consumer, as well as prominently to the extent that it is given in advertising or in other writing or orally.

The directive was written in collaboration with Israel National Cyber Directorate (INCD).

Initially, the Israel National Cyber Directorate (INCD) identified many cases of hacking into smart devices of citizens and organizations that are connected to the Internet, such as home cameras, "smart home" systems, wireless routers, Smart TVs, baby monitors, and more.

Along with the benefit that comes from connecting various smart products to the Internet, there are also risks, since IoT products connected to the Internet are exposed to various cyber and information security risks. These risks may harm the user in a number of ways, from harm to privacy and leakage of personal information to damage to a product or a person.

The Consumer Protection Law establishes the prohibition of misleading a consumer, by act or omission, in an essential detail in the transaction, where one of the essential details is "the use that can be made of the property or service, the benefit that can be derived from them and the risks involved". The law also establishes specific disclosure obligations, for example, "any feature of the property that requires possession or use in a special way to prevent harm to its user or to another person or to the property, during normal use or normal care".

The importance of changing the initial password must be revealed to the consumer, as well as how the password can be changed; If the manufacturer is expected to release security updates regarding the product; the length of time in which the manufacturer is expected to publish security updates for the product; It must be specified, in a detailed and clear manner, how to install the security updates. If it is not possible to change the password or there are no security updates for the product, it is a defect or low quality of the product, which must be disclosed.

To reduce the risk, the Israel National Cyber Directorate (INCD) recommends these actions to protect IoT devices:

1.  Changing the device's default password to a complex and unique password.
2.  Installing manufacturer's official software products - it is recommended to avoid installing non-official software products.
3.  Performing software updates - software updates often contain security patches, which increase the level of protection of the product against attacks, and it is recommended to perform them upon release in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendation.
4.  Verifying the settings - after every software update, technician visit, maintenance, or upgrade, make sure that the settings or passwords have not been changed or returned to the default.
5.  Saving the password - the password should not be passed on to other parties and should be changed periodically.
6.  Home router - hacking into smart devices can also be possible using the home router. It is recommended to change the network name, so that it does not indicate the characteristics of the router, such as model, manufacturer, owner, and location, and to set a unique password for the router.
7.  Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - it is recommended to activate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), which includes an additional factor of authentication, if possible.
8.  Download applications only from official applications stores.
