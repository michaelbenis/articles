From Breach to Recovery: The Pentagon's Operation Buckshot Yankee and the 2008 Cyber Attack on DOD and CENTCOM
==============================================================================================================

The cyber incident that occurred in November 2008 was a significant security breach that targeted classified networks at the [United States Department of Defense](https://www.linkedin.com/company/deptofdefense/) (DOD) and [U.S. Central Command](https://www.linkedin.com/company/u-s-central-command/) (CENTCOM). The incident, which has been described as the "most significant breach of U.S. military computers ever", was caused by a foreign intelligence agency that was able to infiltrate the networks by using a USB flash drive loaded with malware.

The attack began when an infected USB flash drive was inserted into a U.S. military laptop at a base in the Middle East. The malware, which was placed on the drive by the foreign intelligence agency, was able to upload itself onto a network run by CENTCOM. Once inside the network, the malware was able to spread undetected across both classified and unclassified systems, creating a "digital beachhead" from which the foreign actors could siphon classified information to servers under their control.

The malware, known as Agent.btz, was able to propagate itself across the networks by exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system and software applications. It also used a technique known as "spearphishing" to trick users into clicking on malicious links or opening malicious attachments. This allowed the malware to gain access to sensitive information and spread to other systems on the network.

The incident prompted a massive response operation called "Operation Buckshot Yankee" which was aimed at purging infected systems of the malware and preventing a similar attack from happening again. The operation involved disabling all USB drives and other external media devices and conducting a thorough analysis of all systems to identify and remove any traces of the malware.

The incident also prompted a review of U.S. cyber defense strategy and led to the creation of [U.S. Cyber Command](https://www.linkedin.com/company/united-states-cyber-command/), which is responsible for the day-to-day protection of defense networks and support of military and counter-terrorism missions. The Military has also revamped its thinking on cyber defense, conceiving of a two-tiered approach that relies on traditional IT defenses, and that also seeks to leverage the intelligence capabilities of the [National Security Agency](https://www.linkedin.com/company/national-security-agency/) and signals intelligence to provide "active defense" --- spotting emerging attacks and insider threats often dubbed "advanced persistent threats."

The incident highlights the importance of cyber security for critical infrastructure, especially for organizations such as the military that rely on sensitive information to carry out their missions. It also serves as a reminder of the dangers of using removable media such as USB drives and the importance of implementing strict security measures to protect against cyber threats.
