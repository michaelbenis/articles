The National Defense University Cyber Incident: A Case Study in Government Cybersecurity
========================================================================================

In May 2007, the National Defense University (NDU) had to take its email systems offline because of hacks by unknown foreign intruders that left spyware on the system. NDU is a prominent institution that educates senior military and civilian leaders, making it a valuable target for foreign adversaries seeking to gain access to sensitive information and intelligence.

The attackers used a combination of tactics, techniques, and procedures to gain access to NDU's email systems. They likely used spear-phishing emails to trick employees into clicking on a link or opening an attachment that contained malware. Once the malware was installed on the employee's computer, the attackers were able to gain access to the email systems and install spyware to monitor and steal sensitive information.

In addition to spear-phishing, the attackers also likely used Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) tactics, which involve maintaining a long-term presence on a victim's network to steal sensitive information. The attackers were able to evade detection for an extended period of time, allowing them to steal a significant amount of data before being discovered.

The incident was a significant security breach that had a major impact on NDU's operations. The email systems had to be taken offline for several months while the incident was investigated and the systems were cleaned and rebuilt. This disruption to NDU's operations likely had a negative impact on the University's ability to educate senior military and civilian leaders.

This incident highlights the ongoing threat of cyber attacks on government networks and the importance of strong cybersecurity measures to protect critical infrastructure and sensitive information. It also serves as a reminder of the potential national security impact of cyber attacks on educational institutions and the need for organizations to take proactive measures to detect and prevent cyber-attacks.
